Get your func on at fnconf, an inter-disciplinary meeting of minds to facilitate high-value trades between technomaths[^1] and improve our negotiation skills.

[^1]: technology + diplomat = technomath.

## Why

> "For important negotiations we don't send telegrams; we send ambassadors." - Alan Kay

The problem with ambassadors is they only speak one language...typically French. But to travel between worlds, you need to have each of your bi-lingual legs in a different land. To negotiate across borders, you must be fluent in two languages, typically business and tech. You need a diplomat.

## What

fnconf is an informal 1-day/1-night gathering near a beach, a braai and some funky tunes.

- One day.
- Lightning talks (no PowerPoint).
